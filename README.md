Implementation of the classis 0-1 Integer Knapsack Problem
- [Kruskal's Algorithm Minimum Spanning Tree](https://github.com/SleekPanther/kruskals-algorithm-minimum-spanning-tree-mst)  
Java Implementation to find a MST from a graph
- [Breadth First Search / Depth First Search - Graph Algorithms](https://github.com/SleekPanther/breadth-first-search-depth-first-search-graphs)  
Implementation of the common BFS & DFS algorithms
- [Interval Partitioning (Greedy Algorithm)](https://github.com/SleekPanther/interval-partitioning-greedy-algorithm)  
Java Implementation of the greedy algorithm for the Interval Partitioning Problem
- [Fibonacci Algorithms Runtime Comparison](https://github.com/SleekPanther/fibonacci-algorithms-comparison)  
Array Memoization, Recursive & Phi (Golden Ratio) formula
- [Prime Factorization (Java)](https://github.com/SleekPanther/prime-factor-java)  
Cobbled together various existing algorithms for finding Prime Factors. I did not design the algorithms, but focused on creating a way for users to interact more easily
- [Pascal's Triangle](https://github.com/SleekPanther/pascal)  
Used my knowledge of Java arrays to print out an arbitrary number of rows of Pascal's Triangle
- [Java Rounding Improved](https://github.com/SleekPanther/java-math-improved-round)  
A function that allows you to specify how many decimals to round to
- [Java Random() Improved](https://github.com/SleekPanther/java-math-improved-random)  
Several overloaded methods to allow you to specify an upper and lower bound for random numbers
- [Loop Performace (`i++` vs `++i`)](https://github.com/SleekPanther/loop-performance)  
Runtime comparison between post and pre increment

## Python
- [Binary Hexadecimal Conversion](https://github.com/SleekPanther/binary-hexadecimal-conversion)  
Convert hex to binary & binary to hex
- [Alphabet Guessing Game (Python)](https://github.com/SleekPanther/alphabet-guessing-game)  
A very simple game to guess the numerical representation of a letter in the alphabet, or guess the letter from the number (A=1,B=2,...Z=26).  
A semi-trivial game, but I did this to try and teach myself to associate letters with numbers, not just the alphabetical order of letters

<!--
- [Ford Fulkerson Max Flow Algorithm](https://github.com/SleekPanther/ford-fulkerson)  
Finds max flow / min cut in a Flow Network. (Simple version, no capacity scaling)

- [Bipartite Graph Testing Algorithm](https://github.com/SleekPanther/bipartite-algorithm)  
Modification of Breadth First Search to identify bipartite graphs
