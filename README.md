[LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/NoahPatullo)

##Websites (web related)
- [PHP Magic Linking](https://github.com/SleekPanther/php-magic-linking)  
My own invention: a php template that simplifies linking to nested folders & automatically print the correct number of ../ before links
- [Merrill's Roxy Cinema](https://github.com/SleekPanther/roxy)  
Website Final project for database class (CS 148) focusing on the back end managing adding movies & updating showtimes for a generic movie theater
- [Invert Checkbox Selection (& deselect radion buttons)](https://github.com/SleekPanther/checkbox-toggle-selection)  
I created my own jQuery functions based on several examples because I wasn't happy with any existing solutions
- [UVM Bikes](https://github.com/SleekPanther/uvmbikes)  
Website Final Project for web design & css class (CS 142)
- [Pure CSS Dropdown](https://github.com/SleekPanther/css-dropdown)  
Adapted existing tutorial to create mobile-friendly responsive menu. (Most work is **not mine**, but I added comments to help myself & simplify some CSS)
- [Intro Web Design Final Project](https://github.com/SleekPanther/assignment5.0)  
Very simple site for a fake graphic design company. Not my prodest work now, but it was a start when I was learning


##Java
- [Even or Odd Game](https://github.com/SleekPanther/even-odd-game)  
Replicated a simple Android app using JavaFX & skills I learned from CS 110 at UVM
- [Tetris Game](https://github.com/SleekPanther/tetris-java)  
Final Project for CS 110 at UVM (Only the final runnable `.jar` file since the professor doesn't want the solutions to be public)
- [Prime Factorization (Java)](https://github.com/SleekPanther/prime-factor-java)  
Cobbled together various existing algorithms for finding Prime Factors. I did not design the algorithms, but focused on creating a way for users to interact more easily
- [Pascal's Triangle](https://github.com/SleekPanther/pascal)  
Used my knowledge of Java arrays to print out an arbitrary number of rows of Pascal's Triangle

##Python
- [Alphabet Guessing Game (Python)](https://github.com/SleekPanther/alphabet-guessing-game)  
A very simple game to guess the numerical representation of a letter in the alphabet, or guess the letter from the number (A=1,B=2,...Z=26).  
A semi-trivial game, but I did this to try and teach myself to associate letters with numbers, not just the alphabetical order of letters

###Notes
My college's Computer Science department (University of Vermont) has had issues with academic integrity. Some students posted solutions to textbook problems and other students copied them. So my public repositories are only the ones which **do not involve textbook problems or professors' starter code.**  
I have some more private repositories with class assignments and could grant access to potential employers or interested parties if you're interested.
